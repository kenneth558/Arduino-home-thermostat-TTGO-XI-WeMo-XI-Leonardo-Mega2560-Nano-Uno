# Arduino_UNO_home_thermostat
I use this sketch in the Arduino UNO to operate my furnace.  If connected via USB to my Ubuntu headless firewall, I have remote control of it from over the Internet. Uses an old version (0.0.3) of idDHTLib making it in need of upgrading.

The reason I cannot just link to the right version of idDHTLib is because that page (https://github.com/niesteszeck/idDHTLib) does not contain the library version I am using in the sketch.  I tried using a newer version, but the compatibility was lost somewhere along the upgrade path for that library and I had too little incentive to deal with it after getting my sketch going.
