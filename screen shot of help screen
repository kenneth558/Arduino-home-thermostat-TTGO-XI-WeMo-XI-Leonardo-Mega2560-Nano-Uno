A way to save talkback into a file in Ubuntu and Mint Linux is: (except change "TIME_STAMP_THIS" to lower case, not shown)
    nohup stty -F $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1) 19200 -echo;while true;do cat $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1)|while IFS= read -r line;do if ! [[ -z "$line" ]];then echo "$line"|sed 's/^TIME_STAMP_THIS/'"$(date )"'/g';fi;done;done >> /log_directory/arduino.log 2>/dev/null &
