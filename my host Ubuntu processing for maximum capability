The following is the contents of a script file I titled arduinolog and launch at system startup:

#! /bin/bash
trap '' HUP
home_dir="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"
[[ -z "$(ps auxf|grep -v grep|grep 'cat -s /dev/tty')" ]] && nohup stty -F $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1) 57600 -echo
while true;do
	cat -s $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1)|while IFS= read -r line;do
		echo "$line"|sed 's/time_stamp_this/'"$(date)"'/g'
		if [[ "$line" =~ [[:space:]]ALERT[[:space:]] ]];then
#			echo "Attempting to send email to $(cat $home_dir/toemailadds)" >> "$0.log"
			nohup timeout 10 echo "$line"|sed 's/time_stamp_this/'"$(date)"'/g'|/usr/bin/mail -s "Furnace ALERT" "$(cat $home_dir/toemailadds)" 2>/dev/null  &
		fi
	done
done >> "$home_dir/arduino.log" 2>/dev/null &

The file called toemailadds needs to be put in the same directory.  It has email addresses, one per line...simple as that.
Postfix is the emailing program I use.


I use the following Ubuntu bash command from the host terminal manually to send to the Arduino thermostat: (sudo'd as needed or desired)
    stty -F $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1) 57600 -echo;echo "help" > $(ls /dev/ttyA* /dev/ttyU* 2>/dev/null|tail -n1);timeout 2 tail -fn0 /home/homeowner/arduino.log

Then replace "help" with one of the other commands that will be displayed by the command and send again.  NOTE: The baud rate is extremely dependent on the host's ability to receive at speed.


I found firewalling to be important.  I wrote poofitee to be a universal installer of a bulletproof firewall, but soon
realized that Linux is far too fragmented both across flavors and across supporting program upgrades to think I could
maintain it.  With that caveat, help yourself to what I've put out here.
